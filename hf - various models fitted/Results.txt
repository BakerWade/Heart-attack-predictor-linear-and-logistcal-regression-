I dropped 3 columns from this model:

1)  Time: inconclusive data. No unit of measurement provided or no way to determine what the time period represents. 
	Can be included with more data and understanding what this column represents

2) serum_sodium: this data is mostly within the considered 'healthy' bracket of 135-145. The mean of the column is 136. 
	So there is no reason to suspect that normal levels of sodium in this dataset has any relationship with the risk of heart attack. 
	But getting more data might dispute this. src: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6224129/

3) Platelets: Same as serum_sodium, the bulk of the data in this column falls well within 'healthy' bracket of 150k-450k. The mean = 263358.02926421404

#In conclusion, after using 4 differnt models to try to create a decent enough model, I have concluded that both 'RandomForestClassifier' and 'Support Vector machine' are suited for this situation.(more data is needed to distinguish which is best) 
To improve results, a neural net can be considered and more data is definiely required. 
Or balancing the data to have a better distribution of 'DEATH_EVENTS', either by reducing the number of "0" or increasing the amount of "1", by creating  false data[recommended]
#I would not trust using this model in real life, more testing and data is needed before formal use.
