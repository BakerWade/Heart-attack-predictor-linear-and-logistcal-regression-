

creatinine_phosphokinase:Creatine kinase, also known as creatine phosphokinase 
or phosphocreatine kinase, is an enzyme expressed by various tissues and cell 
types. CK catalyses the conversion of creatine and uses adenosine triphosphate
to create phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate. High levels in serum is highly specific and sensitive for 
myocardial cell wall injury.




serum creatinine: A serum creatinine test measures the level of creatinine in 
your blood and provides an estimate of how well your kidneys filter 
(glomerular filtration rate). A creatinine urine test can measure creatinine in 
your urine. A significant subset of patients with heart failure (HF) experience 
small to moderate rise in serum creatinine (RSC) in the setting of otherwise 
beneficial therapies such as aggressive diuresis or 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition

serum sodium: A sodium blood test is a routine test that allows your doctor to see how 
much sodium is in your blood. It's also called a serum sodium test. 
Sodium is an essential mineral to your body. It's also referred to as Na+. 
Sodium is particularly important for nerve and muscle function. Hyponatremia or 
low serum sodium level is typically defined as a serum sodium concentration 
of <135 mEq/L and is one of the most common biochemical disorders featured in heart
failure patients, with a prevalence close to 25% [2–4]. HF affects cardiac output by either 
decreasing heart rate or reducing the stroke volume.
