# Heart-attack-predictor-linear-and-logistcal-regression-

Using a dataset found on Kaggle, I created a few visual representations and then a linear regression model and a logistical regression model to determine the chances of someone dying from a heart attack given the data available. 
I decided on using 2 models as I am faily new to data science and was curious to see the difference in predictions obtained from each model. This is still a work in progress, so feel free to give input or offer advice.
