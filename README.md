# Heart-attack-predictor-varioys models fitted-

Using a dataset found on Kaggle, I created a few visual representations and then a linear regression model, logistical regression model, random tree forests and support vector machines to determine the chances of someone dying from a heart attack given the data available. 
I am faily new to data science and was curious to see the difference in predictions obtained from each model. This is still a work in progress, so feel free to give input or offer advice.
